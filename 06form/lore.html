        <h1>The Forgotten Realms</h1>
        <h2>The Official Setting of Dungeons and Dragons &trade;</h2>
        <p>The Forgotten Realms is a fantasy world filled with magic, powerful gods, ancient ruins, and diverse cultures. It is one of the most well-known settings in Dungeons & Dragons. Most adventures take place on the continent of Faerûn, which is home to bustling cities like Waterdeep, dangerous wilderness areas, and secretive underground realms like the Underdark.</p>

        <p>Realms are shaped by conflicts between heroes and villains, gods and mortals, and kingdoms and monsters. Magic is common, and powerful wizards, clerics, and adventurers play major roles in shaping the world’s history.</p>
            
        <p>Created by Ed Greenwood and developed over many editions of D&D, the Forgotten Realms offers a rich setting for any kind of fantasy adventure, from epic battles to political intrigue.</p>
        <h2>When Creating Your Character</h2>

            <li>Character Creation rooted in Forgotten Realms races, classes, and backgrounds</li>
            <li>Play D&D 5e in the context of the Realms' politics, deities, and history</li>
        </ul>
